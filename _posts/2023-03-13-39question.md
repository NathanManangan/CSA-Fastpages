# MCQ
### Score : 34/39
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/39Questions.png "Final Score")

### Q9
I got this one wrong because each value has equal probability, versus splitting up the dice which would make certain probabilities more, and 1 cannot be included so E is correct.

### Q11
The answer is wrong because the reverse of “nono” is “onon” and since these two strings are not equal, the method will return false and the answer is E

### Q19
The answer is wrong because when you substring(3 + 1, word.length()) + substring(0 , 3), the 3 is not included when you print the result of those two strings being added together, so the answer is ilercom rather than pilercom

### Q30
I'm going to be 100% honest, I did not see the top part when doing this problem, which resulted in my error because I thought it was just the little part was the whole problem. The answer is c because every loop of mystery generates the value of the [index] + [index + 1] when printing.

### Q31
This answer is wrong because when it goes through the loop, I thought since it was multiplying by n each time that the n would be the exponent. However, this is not the case since the base would actually be 4, since it's going to be multiplied by 4 each time.

### Q33
This answer is wrong because I thought the loop would end after the sum reached 12, then it would print 12. However, this is wrong because I failed to recognize that k is never increased throughout the loop, so the while loop is always true and will never stop running and print an error.
