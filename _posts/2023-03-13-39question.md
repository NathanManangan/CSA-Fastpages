### Score : 34/39
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/39Questions.png "Final Score")

### Q9
I got this one wrong because each value has equal probability, versus splitting up the dice which would make certain probabilities more, and 1 cannot be included so E is correct.

### Q11
The answer is wrong because the reverse of “nono” is “onon” and since these two strings are not equal, the method will return false and the answer is E

### Q19
The answer is wrong because all 3 statements are correct. Statement two only runs once so it wont print anything, and Statement three only contains odd numbers so it wont print anything since % 2 wont do anything, and the answer is E

### Q30
This answers is wrong because the first one just runs each segment of code versus only running if it has a certain condition, which would be checked in else if and else, so only two works.

### Q31
This answer is wrong because as it loops through, it creates less and less X's into the code and the one i selected would be possible if there was for loops checking for even or odd.
