## Questions
### Q12
I approached this problem by trying to plug in values for x and y, but it seems that I messed up somewhere
Looking back, the answer was obvious as an or statement between the two expressions doesn’t quite work out
Q13: Assume that x and y are boolean variables and have been properly initialized. (x || y) && x Which of the following always evaluates to the same value as the expression above? I chose x && y but the answer was x

### Q15 
I said the answer was containsArt ("matriculate", "carat", "arbitrary") but the answer was containsArt ("rattrap", "similar", "today"). My initial guess was that adding up all of the strings makes anything that was separate in the 3 strings together, meaning that if art was formed when strings were added together, that is an issue, which it seems to be in the correct answer!

### Q16
I said that Line 10 should be changed to sum += arr[row][col]; but in reality, the answer was Line 8 should be changed to for (int[] row : arr). There was no issue in line 10 if we initially just the for loop and make it into a special for loop.

### Q22 
The count doesnt include the last element in the array so if there is an a at the end, it will not function properly

### Q29
Since the array only goes to the 2nd to last term, it will not get the last term, 8 is the answer, not 7 as 7 is literally the first value. Make sure to look out for the first and last terms of an array when doing error problems. Common theme that the error is in the first or last entry in the array

### Q35


D produces the same things because it has the same indexes but just goes backwards
Notes:
B is definitely wrong because it literally starts and ends at different indexes
Q38:


Only 2 has the same behavior
Should’ve got this right, very easy question that only requires plugging in values into both and seeing if they are equal
Q39:


2000 was a leap year but 1900 was not
I simply mixed up my leap year rules (not a code issue, literally a skill issue)
Q40:


First need to check if the initial num of vals is 0 because if so, you would just return whats already there
C is unnecessary to the code
Q53:


It is very necessary to initialize the value of the total to be 1 initially so that the code works as intended, it isn’t needed that the while loops runs for x <= n
Takeaways
I need to focus on making sure that when I plug in different scenarios, I am writing down outputs
Consider doing a truth table like I learned in Discrete Math
Look at first and last indexes for errors in error questions
Make sure that when matching, the output, as well as the input, are identical to one another!
