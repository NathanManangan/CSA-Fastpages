# Unit 7 Arraylist

## Notes
- Reference type : Mutable and contains object references
- can be changed dynamically
- for + while loop for traversing a list, for(String name : roster) - ehanced for loop goes through each thing in a loop
- array is double[] values, arraylist is ArrayList<Double> values
- Searching - locating data within linear structures (iteration, selection)
- order matter in searching, resolved if you go backwards
- sorting : sorting in ascending/specified order
