<h2 id="questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions</h2>
<h3 id="q1">
<a class="anchor" href="#q1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q1</h3>
<p>I was right initially, but I was somehow convinced by Nicholas Ramos that I was wrong, when I was in fact very right.</p>

<h3 id="q2">
<a class="anchor" href="#q2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q2</h3>
<p>Again, Nicholas Ramos made me rethink my answer and I made a silly blunder when I had the right answer within my grasp.</p>

<h3 id="q7">
<a class="anchor" href="#q7" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q7</h3>
<p>Wrong because I forgot to look at the actual return statement, which prints out the value of the substring rather than printing out 1 when true.</p>

<h3 id="q12">
<a class="anchor" href="#q12" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q12</h3>
<p>I didn’t fully read the students.set(), because I thouhgt it was printing out Alex first, then the students after, but it is reversed instead.</p>

<h3 id="q15">
<a class="anchor" href="#q15" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q15</h3>
<p>Wrong because I initially forgot to take into account the starting of count at 0, even though that is typical of code. I instead thought of the first index as 1, and it screwed up the whole problem from there, so the correct answer is E</p>

<h3 id="q16">
<a class="anchor" href="#q16" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q16</h3>
<p>I genuinely just miscounted the a’s in the words, simple fix</p>

<h3 id="q20">
<a class="anchor" href="#q20" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q20</h3>
<p>I misread the &gt; as a &lt;, which made me think it was saying whenever j+k is greater then is adds a value, but it is the opposite that whenever j+k is less than it adds,</p>

<h3 id="q23">
<a class="anchor" href="#q23" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q23</h3>
<p>It isnt C because the .size()-1 for this case shouldnt be applies to the sizeOfList because that is the one getting looped in the for loop, on the k should get the -1</p>

<h3 id="q24">
<a class="anchor" href="#q24" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q24</h3>
<p>I thought it was an out of bounds exception because I thought the +2 would go to 6 and it would not be within the bounds, but turns out it stops before the 5th iteration because it is &lt; and -1, making the answer C</p>

<h3 id="q25">
<a class="anchor" href="#q25" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q25</h3>
<p>In this question I was partially right, because I understood the algorithm, but didn’t realize that whenever the list added and deleted elements, it would loop through the new list instead of the old one, which messed me up.</p>

<h3 id="q29">
<a class="anchor" href="#q29" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q29</h3>
<p>I have no idea how I got this wrong, because it is very easy, I must have been tired since I did this quiz very late at night. The mistake was that everything was printed, not just the stuff in quotes.</p>

<h3 id="q35">
<a class="anchor" href="#q35" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q35</h3>
<p>I got this wrong because I didn’t realize it printed just the index and not the value itself, which is a careless mistake</p>

<h3 id="q43">
<a class="anchor" href="#q43" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q43</h3>
<p>For some reason I thought howFar was the size of the string, rather than the clearly obvious word.length(), which made me impulsively clicky click the out of bounds, when the correct answer is C</p>

<h3 id="q44">
<a class="anchor" href="#q44" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q44</h3>
<p>This one I got wrong, because I didnt realize it took the shortest one out of all 3 values, I think I may have guessed on this one. But D is correct because it takes the shortest of the values until it reaches the 4th index where it can only pick the 4th option</p>

<h3 id="q45">
<a class="anchor" href="#q45" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q45</h3>
<p>I thought for some reason this one added both j and k values to the sm, but it just checks which one of the indexes are greater or less than the j value.</p>

<h3 id="q48">
<a class="anchor" href="#q48" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q48</h3>
<p>For some reason I guess that I forgot valueList didn’t need to be called again if its defined within the variable, which is why I thought 3 was wrong, but it is right and makes D correct.</p>

<h3 id="q50">
<a class="anchor" href="#q50" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q50</h3>
<p>I just glossed over the fact that it printed the same k value for the j value, which makes it the second term in the second row, not the second row first term etc etc.</p>

<h3 id="q52">
<a class="anchor" href="#q52" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Q52</h3>
<p>I tried to understand this one, but I was tired and it was the last one so I just guessed on this one, The answer is E because every time the value of val % 2 is 1, then it changes the original 0 to a X, but it stops after the 4th one because the loop stops.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h2>
<p>I need to focus more, and carefully pay attention to the tiny details within the for loops of a problem, especially when the problems are simple.</p>
